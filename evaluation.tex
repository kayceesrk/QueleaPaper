\section{Evaluation}

In this section, we evaluate \name programs and report the contract profile as
well as illustrating the performance benefits of fine-grained consistency
classification on operations and transactions. We also report on the impact of
the summarization. We implemented the following applications, which includes
RDTs as well as larger applications composed of severals RDTs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{LWW register}: A last-write-wins register.
\item \textbf{DynamoDB register}: A integer register that allows eventual and
strong puts and gets, conditional puts, increment and decrement operations.
\item \textbf{Bank account}: Our running example, with savings and current
accounts.
\item \textbf{Shopping list}: Collaborative shopping list which allows adding
and deleting items.
\item \textbf{Online store}: Models an online store with shopping cart and
dynamically changing item prices. Checkout process verifies that the custormer
only pays the accepted price.
\item \textbf{RuBis}: An ebay-like auction site~\cite{}.
\item \textbf{Microblog}: A twitter-like microblogging site, modelled after
Twissandra~\cite{}.
\end{itemize}
