\section{Transaction Contracts}

While contracts on individual operations offer the programmer object-level
declarative reasoning, real-world scenarios often involve operations that span
multiple objects. In order to address this problem, several recent
systems~\cite{COPS,BurckhardtESOP,BailisHAT} have proposed a variety of
transactions, with varying semantics, in order to compose operations on
multiple objects. However, given that classical transaction models such as
serializability~\cite{} and snapshot isolation~\cite{} require inter-replica
coordination, these systems espouse \emph{coordination-free transactions} that
remain available under network partitions, but only provide weaker isolation
guarantees.

Coordination-free transactions have intricate consistency semantics and widely
varying runtime overheads. As with operation-level consistency, the onus is on
the programmer to pick the correct transaction kind, the choice of which is
complicated by the consistency requirement of the operations it composes. \name
automates the choice of assigning the correct and most efficient transaction
isolation level.
