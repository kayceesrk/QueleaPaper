\section{Implementation}

In this section, we describe the instantiation of \name on top of off-the-shelf
eventually consistent distributed store Cassandra. We begin with a description
of the programming interface.

The programmer simply pairs up the operation implementation with the
corresponding contract to complete the RDT implementation. The contracts are
statically checked, and mapped to the corresponding store consistency level.
The store is exposed as a collection key-indexed, object-valued tables, where
each table holds objects of the same type. The transaction language operates
over this view, and has primitives to invoke an operation on an object, and
invoke a transaction on a sequence of operation invocations. The transaction
contract is also statically checked and classified.
