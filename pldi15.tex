\title{Declarative Programming over Eventually Consistent Databases }

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
User-facing online services utilize geo-distributed data stores to minimize
latency and tolerate partial failures, with the intention to provide a fast,
always-on experience. However, geo-distribution does not come for free;
application developers have to contend with weak consistency behaviors, and the
lack of abstractions to composably construct high-level replicated data types,
neccesitating complex application logic and invariably exposing inconsistencies
to the user. Commercial distributed data stores and sevaral academic proposals
do propose a lattice of stronger consisteny levels. However, assigning the
correct consistency level for an operation is a error prone task.

In this paper, we present Quelea, a declarative programming model for
eventually consistent data stores. Quelea allows expressive convergent
replicated data types to be defined over an append-only set abstraction. Quelea
is equipped with a \emph{contract} language, capable of expressing fine-grained
application-level consistency properties. A \emph{contract enforcement system}
logically analyses the contracts using an SMT solver, and automatically maps it
to the store's consistency level. We describe an implementation of Quelea on
top of an off-the-shelf eventually consistent data store, and support
coordination-free transactions. Several benchmarks including two large web
applications, illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.
